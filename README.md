# vortex-model

Integrate a system of N point vortices. 

Created for the PSU class METEO 523 â€“ Modeling the climate system.

## Equations

## Example visualizations

Releasing tracers into the rotating N-vortex system:

Also includes tool for making Poincare plots, given a sufficiently long run with a large number (e.g. 100) of tracers. You can make pretty pictures like this:

## TODO:

* [ ] Add the Poincare output as an option to the Fortran code 
* [ ] Convert the two test scripts to a Jupyter Notebook for example
* [ ] Write Python interface to the Fortran version as practice?
